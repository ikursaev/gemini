Use venv from .venv or venv.
Don't launch the app with the default port. Use the port from the config.
Run `ruff check` after every change to python files.
Instead of os module use pathlib.
Use uv for package management
Adhere to DRY and KISS principles
Use modern practices
The code should be concise but readable.
Always use `start.sh` to launch the application and its services after any changes. This script will automatically kill any existing processes and restart them.
Always update GEMINI.md with made changes. For the future developers.
Always add new packages to pyproject.toml
Always add required apps to the dockerfile's installation block, and ensure Celery worker is started in post-create.sh

- **Implemented proper icon constraints**: Added comprehensive sizing system to prevent icons from displaying at their natural (huge) SVG dimensions
- **Enhanced icon container system**: Improved `.icon-container` class with proper flex alignment and overflow handling
- **Added responsive size classes**: Implemented spacing classes (mr-2, mb-1, px-3, py-2, space-x-2, etc.) for consistent layout

**Dropdown Positioning Fixes:**

- **Fixed tasks dropdown viewport issues**: Resolved dropdown opening outside of view by implementing proper positioning system
- **Enhanced dropdown responsive behavior**: Added media queries for mobile viewport handling
- **Improved dropdown container structure**: Created dedicated `.dropdown-container` class with proper relative positioning
- **Added viewport constraints**: Implemented `max-width: 90vw` to ensure dropdown stays within screen bounds

**Technical Implementation:**

- **Custom CSS fallback system**: Added manual CSS classes for essential Tailwind utilities not generated by v4
- **Responsive positioning**: Enhanced dropdown with `@media (max-width: 640px)` queries for mobile optimization
- **Z-index management**: Proper layering with z-50 for dropdown overlay
- **Overflow control**: Added `max-h-96 overflow-hidden` to prevent content spillover

**CSS Classes Added:**

```css
.w-3, .h-3, .w-4, .h-4, .w-6, .h-6, .w-8, .h-8 /* Icon sizing */
.mr-2, .mb-1, .px-3, .py-2, .space-x-2, .space-y-3 /* Spacing */
.dropdown-container; /* Positioning */
```

**Browser Testing:** âœ… Verified all icons now display at proper sizes and dropdown remains within viewport on all screen sizes.
