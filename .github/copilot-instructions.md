# Python Coding Conventions

## Python Instructions

- Write clear and concise comments for each function.
- Ensure functions have descriptive names and include type hints.
- Provide docstrings following PEP 257 conventions.
- Use the `typing` module for type annotations (e.g., `List[str]`, `Dict[str, int]`).
- Break down complex functions into smaller, more manageable functions.

## General Instructions

- Always prioritize readability and clarity.
- For algorithm-related code, include explanations of the approach used.
- Write code with good maintainability practices, including comments on why certain design decisions were made.
- Handle edge cases and write clear exception handling.
- For libraries or external dependencies, mention their usage and purpose in comments.
- Use consistent naming conventions and follow language-specific best practices.
- Write concise, efficient, and idiomatic code that is also easily understandable.

## Code Style and Formatting

- Follow the **PEP 8** style guide for Python.
- Maintain proper indentation (use 4 spaces for each level of indentation).
- Ensure lines do not exceed 79 characters.
- Place function and class docstrings immediately after the `def` or `class` keyword.
- Use blank lines to separate functions, classes, and code blocks where appropriate.

## Edge Cases and Testing

- Always include test cases for critical paths of the application.
- Account for common edge cases like empty inputs, invalid data types, and large datasets.
- Include comments for edge cases and the expected behavior in those cases.
- Write unit tests for functions and document them with docstrings explaining the test cases.

## Example of Proper Documentation

```python
def calculate_area(radius: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the area of a circle given the radius.

    Parameters:
    radius (float): The radius of the circle.

    Returns:
    float: The area of the circle, calculated as Ï€ * radius^2.
    """
    import math
    return math.pi * radius ** 2
```

# App Instructions

Use venv from .venv or venv.
Don't launch the app with the default port. Use the port from the config.
Run `ruff check --fix` after every change to python files.
Instead of os module use pathlib.
Use uv for package management
Adhere to DRY and KISS principles
Use modern practices
The code should be concise but readable.
Always use `start.sh` to launch the application and its services after any changes. This script will automatically kill any existing processes and restart them.
Always update GEMINI.md and `.github\copilot-instructions.md` with made changes. For the future developers.
Always add new packages to pyproject.toml
Always add required apps to the dockerfile's installation block, and ensure Celery worker is started in post-create.sh
Always use the browser to test the application after making changes, ensuring that all functionalities work as expected.

## UI Enhancements (2025-06-28)

- Added a bounce animation to the "Tasks" button when a new file is uploaded, indicating a new task.
- Implemented counters on the "Tasks" button to display the number of pending and completed tasks.
- Enhanced the file upload area to support both drag-and-drop and click-to-select functionalities, improving user interaction for file uploads.
- Integrated Tailwind CSS into the project's build process. To compile Tailwind CSS, run `npm run build:tailwind`.
- Removed custom CSS from `app/static/input.css` to rely solely on Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Applied inline styles to SVG elements in `app/templates/index.html` to ensure correct icon sizing.
- Reverted `app/static/input.css` to only contain `@tailwind` directives.
